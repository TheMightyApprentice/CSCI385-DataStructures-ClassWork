ABOUT THE STABLE MATCHING FILE:

-This program is an implementation of the stable marriage/matching algorithm.

-For a definition of the stable matching algorithm as well as examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem

-When running the program:

--First, the program will ask if you want to have it go through numerous test cases or run the main code.

--If test cases are selected, the program will output the results of the test cases.

--If the main code is run:

---The program will ask for a file for the men (priorityOne.dat or your own file name).

---Then, one for the women (priorityTwo.dat or your own file name).

---Lastly, the program will ask for the amount n of men and women (if using the .dat files provided the answer will be 3).

-The numbers in priorityTwo.dat represent the women's preferences for men in terms of their position in priorityOne.dat.
